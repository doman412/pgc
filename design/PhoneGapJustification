Small justification to using PhoneGap API

YAY

1. Write "once" deploy on all of our targets. 

2. All deliverables will have a consistent UI and feel.

3. Has Geolocation support.

4. Licensed under the Apache license, ?? I need to look up more info on this.


NAY

1. Fuck CSS

2. Anyone have experience with JS, CSS3, HTML5?!

3. Performance issues?? probably not in an app like this.
